# Native iPadOS port plan

## Mission and operating requirements

Deliver the original Need for Speed II Special Edition as a native ARM64 iPad
app for iPad Air M3 with controller input, accelerated graphics and game audio.
Use separately supplied original assets; no x86 emulation or JIT. Keep compiler,
linker, package, signing and physical gameplay evidence separate.

Two requirements are part of the goal:

1. Use standard public GitHub Actions efficiently. Build only to answer a
   specific remaining Apple SDK or packaging question after relevant local
   checks pass. Use the bounded, manual, sequential workflow in CI_POLICY.md.
   Avoid duplicate builds and unchanged deterministic failure reruns.
2. Publish only reviewed source and public documentation. Independently audit
   files and Git metadata before every commit or push. Keep credentials, signing
   material, original assets, captures, private evidence and personal filesystem
   information outside the public repository.

## Current shared implementation

- Explicit mapped 32-bit game values with full-width native pointers.
- Original translated functions linked to native platform services.
- File, event, thread, timer, audio, input, renderer and lifecycle boundaries.
- Asset import validates and copies separately supplied files into owned app storage.
- Local original menu/race rendering, keyboard driving and generated game PCM.
- Host regression and sanitizer checks, plus portable ARM64 compile checks.

Build 8 physical feedback reports playable racing and better FPS, with lower
split-screen performance and an intermittent unmapped-engine-span race failure.
Build 10 has passed sequential Linux and Apple checks and independent downloaded
package inspection. Its memory-check optimizations and ThinLTO retain ownership
and bounds checks. Physical split-screen FPS and stability remain pending.

## Remaining sequence

1. Reach constant 60 FPS in full-detail native-resolution split-screen racing
   and fix the intermittent race failure with a verified cause. Use both players;
   remap both original control profiles after selecting split-screen. Preserve
   original pointer/span rejection while investigating. Local measurements select
   candidates; physical iPad tests establish performance and crash acceptance.
2. Then remove controller-to-keyboard aliases and prevent resume presses from
   also triggering car actions. Retain native analog remapping and text entry.
3. Then map touch movement to the cursor, one-finger tap to click, two-finger tap
   to Escape and three-finger tap to Enter.
4. Finally investigate sharper HUD text, speedometer, map and starting lights.
   Original assets remain private and unchanged.
5. Continue scoped controller reconnect, audio, lifecycle, signing refresh and
   complete-race acceptance. Repeat only affected Apple build/package gates when
   relevant source changes justify another controlled standard-runner build.

Completion requires stable, playable original-game behavior on the physical
iPad with the controller and native audio/graphics. A host test or an unsigned
IPA alone is insufficient.


This source revision removes a duplicate region lookup after the production
heap resolver has already verified the complete span belongs to a live allocation.
Allocation ownership, bounds, copy serialization and cancellation checks remain.
The production link test now covers 29 static-region/heap boundary and allocation
lifetime cases; both original and optimized full ThinLTO engines pass. Separate
ASan/UBSan checks match 7,744 lifetime/boundary outcomes and 16,005 original matrix
states. An additional 432 exact boundary outcomes match optimized and sanitized
builds. The current original-game split-screen pair remapped both players and
kept both cars active at native render size. Both runs stopped cleanly with
nonzero captured audio. The optimized game worker used about 12.65% less CPU
per presented frame in this pair; host FPS did not improve. Natural car positions
vary, and software-rendered Linux results do not establish iPad performance or
repair the intermittent race failure. Build 9 remains the latest packaged IPA;
this source change has no Apple build or physical-device acceptance yet.


The next performance candidate adds conservative logical-chunk ownership
metadata to avoid repeated allocation-span cache searches for fully owned
single-chunk requests. It retains all original bounds, ownership, cancellation
and copy-serialization safeguards. Initialization and allocation-failure rollback
are separately validated. The production link regression now has 45 span and
lifetime cases, including large chunks, cross-chunk requests and smaller reuse.

Two original North Country split-screen comparisons ran in opposite orders,
with both native player profiles remapped, native rendering and captured audio.
Observed game-thread CPU time per presented frame fell about 7.2-7.4%, while
Linux software-rendered FPS rose about 2.3-3.2%. Natural traffic varies between
runs; these observations are not physical iPad measurements or a formal causal
speedup estimate. A longer corrected-header session exercised independent
steering/throttle and exited cleanly, but the test driver hit barriers and did
not complete a lap. No intermittent split-screen crash repair is established.
The separately inspected original Split Screen graphics menu showed car detail
on, far view distance and horizon on.

Build 10 is now the latest independently inspected package. Its single deliberate
Apple SDK build passed. Constant 60 FPS and full-race stability remain required,
unverified physical targets.


Build 10 delivery used source 22f8bcb026669c891e87dc7010bdc9c7a0d0a9bb and
[manual run 38941504663](https://github.com/nabeelalam/nfs2seios/actions/runs/38941504663).
Linux completed in 145 seconds, then Apple completed in 449 seconds. The
downloaded thin ARM64 Release package has the existing app identity and version
10, with only executable, metadata and licenses. Source, release digest, contents
and private-path checks pass; there are no original assets, signing files,
sanitizer runtimes or Actions artifact uploads. Apple host regressions and
baseline/ThinLTO mixed-state checks pass; the changed memory runtime compiles
with C++14, O3 and ThinLTO for the iOS device target. This is package/compiler
validation, not physical split-screen 60 FPS or intermittent crash acceptance.


The next input candidate retains build 10's accepted split-screen rendering
configuration. Controller buttons use native joystick state and frontend input,
without also sending keyboard aliases. Short menu presses and control-recording
presses have separate bounded ownership; closing a menu consumes held buttons
until release so a resume press cannot also shift. Both controller profiles and
analog remapping remain supported. Player one's Back/View button resets the car.

A small keyboard icon below the performance overlay shows or hides the system
keyboard. Use it for names or Return when opening a control-recording prompt.
It stays available for explicit dismissal; automatic field detection is deferred.
Touch works as a relative trackpad: move one finger to move the original cursor,
tap one finger to click, two fingers for Escape, and three fingers for Enter.
Chords commit only after the last finger lifts. Long presses, pans and cancelled
gestures do not also click. This adds menu input, not touch racing buttons.

Local Clang C++14 address/undefined sanitizer checks pass 34 tests. Actual SDL
finger-event injection moves the original cursor and exercises all three tap
actions in the original menus. A two-player original race regression exercises
manual shifts, held/fresh resume, reset and injected background/foreground
recovery, with clean shutdown. These are Linux functional checks, not physical
iPad touch/keyboard acceptance or new iPad FPS or energy measurements. The user
accepted build 10 at split-screen 60 FPS; this input revision needs its own
physical regression. Reported battery drain still needs controlled measurement.
